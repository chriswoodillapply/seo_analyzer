DEPRECATED: This test file needs major refactoring for the new architecture

Test Enhanced SEO Analyzer Features Based on Screaming Frog Analysis

These tests validated features like:
- Enhanced H1-H6 analysis
- Google pixel-based title/description lengths  
- Anchor text quality analysis
- Image file size detection
- URL length analysis
- Security header analysis

The tests need to be rewritten to use the new modular architecture where
individual tests are in src/tests/ organized by category.

TODO: Refactor these tests to:
1. Test individual test modules in src/tests/
2. Use SEOOrchestrator for integration tests
3. Follow the patterns in test_orchestrator.py and test_test_executor.py
